# Iris-Classification-Model

Machinelearning is taking over the world now a days 
In an epic journey of learning Machinelearning, I worked on this Iris Dataset and built a model using predefined modules.

This Model predicts the type of iris with the data that is given in the dataset to distinguish.

I have built two models 1.KNN model and 2.Logistic Regression and compared the accuracy of my both models.
